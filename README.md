# BAN5753_Spark_Team_13
A private GitHub for Team 13 to allow professors and Teacher Assistants to properly grade our work. 

1. Business problem:
   
 - The objective of the classification is to identify clients who will subscribe (yes/no) for a term deposit. (Variable y: Target function).
 - The Bank wants us to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify relationships, trends in data. For example: correlations, bivariate analysis of target versus input variables, facts, univariate patterns, missing data,
 - Develop and save a predictive model to roll out for future use. Explore different techniques and share your findings about the approach and benefits of the champion model.
 - Prescriptive recommendations if any
 - K-means Clustering is optional (Bonus point)
 - If you are comparing more than four different supervised algorithms (bonus point). You can utilize the Pyspark or spark-Scala platform for this Mini project.

2. Dataset information:
 
 - Data is about an XYZ bankâ€™s direct marketing campaign. Marketing campaigns were driven by telephone calls.
 - Data Set In many cases, more than one contact for the same client was required., in order to access if the product (deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed
 - The purpose of the classification is to forecast whether the customer will signup (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
 - The dataset: XYZ_Bank_Deposit_Data_Classification.csv, 20 entries/columns, sorted by date between May 2008 and November 2010.
